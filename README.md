# Employee Attrition Prediction & Reason Analyzer

This project uses Machine Learning to predict employee turnover and explains the underlying causes using SHAP (Explainable AI).

## 🚀 Project Overview
- **Goal:** Predict if an employee will leave the company.
- **Accuracy:** 91% (Logistic Regression) / 88% (Random Forest).
- **Key Insight:** Overtime and Monthly Income are the top drivers of attrition.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy)
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Machine Learning:** Scikit-Learn (Random Forest, Logistic Regression)
- **Explainability:** SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)

## 📊 Key Results
- **91% Accuracy** on test data.
- **SHAP Analysis:** Identified that employees working overtime are significantly more likely to leave.
- **Feature Engineering:** Created custom metrics like 'Experience Ratio' to improve model depth.
